/* This program controls the rotational speed and direction of
 * a DC motor.
 *
 * The Wytec EduPad board has a quad half-H-bridge motor driver,
 * which is capable of driving two DC motors or a stepper motor
 * with up to 15V and 1.2A continuous current.
 *
 * The enable pins of the half-bridges are connected to PORTB 3-0.
 * The PWM inputs are connected to PORTF 2 and PORTF 3.  These
 * pins are shared with the LEDs.  The PORTB pins are connected to
 * the LEDs on the EduBase board.  The PORTF pins are connected to
 * the LEDs on the Tiva LaunchPad.
 *
 * The four output pins of the motor driver device are connected to
 * the blue terminals marked M1, M2, M3, and M4.  Use of external
 * power supply for motor is recommended.  External power should be
 * connected to the terminal T3 and the jumper J4 should be at EXT.
 *
 * This program uses PORTB 3, 2 for direction control and PORTF 3 for
 * PWM control.  The outputs are terminals M3 and M4.
 * The PWM is generated by PWM1_3B.
 *
 * Built and tested with Keil MDK-ARM v5.24a and TM4C_DFP v1.1.0

        //NOTE: MAX speed (160 rpm) seems to have a period of around 4000/4100 (CC_Difference)
        //THOUGHT PROCESS: 160 rpm is around 2.6666667 rotations per second (rps) so normally
        //you would divide the 160 rpm by the 2.666667 which would roughly give you 60 rpm which is 1 rps.
        //This number I think is useful because if you can find the period (CC_Difference) of 60 rpm
        //all you would need to do is multiply that period by 60 to get the period of 1 rpm
        //Then you can create the rpm formula as follows: CC_Difference_of_1rpm/CC_Difference = rpm to display
        //For example if CC_Difference of 1rpm was 1000 and the CC_Difference was 50 that would equal 20 rpm.
        //NOTE: Using the Thoughts above if 160 rpm has a period of 4000 than we would multiply this by 2.666667 to get
        //period of 60 rpm which is 10667 (CC_Difference) multiply that by 60 to get the period of 1 rpm which would be 640000

        //I should next test if 10667 is the period of 60 rpm
        //Idea 1: This can be done in a few ways I could use a voltage divder to send 3v into the board and because 60 rpm is max speed at
        //this voltage I could see what period shows on the LCD and if the calculations are correct
        //Idea 2: I could just try to formula as is for now and test if the numbers make sense when displayed on LCD
        //(for now whole numbers are okay than I can implement the fixed notation after using the slides)
        //656000

        //Formula works
        //To use pw to chage the rpm to your liking just assume that 3999 is 160 RPM.
        //So you can get 60 RPM by do 60/160 = 0.375. Than use this 0.375 and multiply it by the 3999 to get 1499
        //Which gives the 60 rpm
        //Tested trying to get 60 rpm using the equation above. I got 56 rpm which is a 7 percent error percent
